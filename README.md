# FCM Channels and Testing Notifications
This project demonstrates how to implement a dynamic notification system using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Users can subscribe to specific channels and receive targeted push notifications. The system ensures seamless delivery and handling of notifications in both foreground and background states.

## üöÄ Features
Subscribe/unsubscribe to dynamic notification channels.
Targeted messaging to specific topics or users.
Push notifications work in both app foreground and background states.
Easy-to-use interface for channel management.
## üìã Task Overview
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Firebase and Messaging
Firebase Configuration:

Integrate Firebase into the project for push notifications.
Ensure FCM setup for at least one platform (e.g., Web, Android, iOS).
Basic User Interface:

Create a simple UI displaying a list of channels available for subscription.
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription Functionality
Enable users to:

Subscribe to notification channels.
Unsubscribe from channels as needed.
Test the setup by sending notifications:

To all users.
To specific topics (channels).
To specific devices (if supported).
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Push Notification Testing
Foreground Notifications:
Verify how notifications are displayed and handled when the app is open and active.

Background Notifications:
Observe how notifications behave when the app is minimized or closed.

Behavior Analysis:
Note any differences or limitations in notification handling between states.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
